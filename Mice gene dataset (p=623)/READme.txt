
This folder contains the code to reproduce the figures of Subsection 6.2 of the article 
"Large-scale Bayesian Structure Learning for Gaussian Graphical Models using Marginal Pseudo-likelihood". 

Reproducing the code can be done in three steps: 
1. Loading and preparing the data.
2. Running the algorithms.
3. Interpreting the results and creating the figures.

Please refer to the read me files in the corresponding folders for more information.
