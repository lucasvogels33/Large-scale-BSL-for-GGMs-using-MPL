
This folder contains the code to read the results. This is the third of three steps needed to reproduce the results 
of Subsection 6.2 of the article "Large-scale Bayesian Structure Learning for Gaussian Graphical Models using Marginal Pseudo-likelihood". 

This folder contains the following files:
- final_0.01_BD.Rdata (file containing the results of the BD algorithm. This file was created in the second step.)
- final_0.01_CONCORD.Rdata (file containing the results of the CONCORD algorithm. This file was created in the second step.)
- final_0.01_MPLBD.Rdata (file containing the results of the MPLBD algorithm. This file was created in the second step.)
- final_0.01_MPLRJ.Rdata (file containing the results of the MPLRJ algorithm. This file was created in the second step.)
- final_0.01_SS.Rdata (file containing the results of the SS algorithm. This file was created in the second step.)
- gene_ID_names.Rdata (file containing the gene IDs and their corresponding gene names. This file was created in the first step.)
- read_mice_output (Rscript that loads all .Rdata files and creates all tables and figures)
