This folder contains the code to reproduce the figures of Subsection 6.1 ("Application to Human Gene Expression") of the article  "Large-scale Bayesian Structure Learning for Gaussian Graphical Models using Marginal Pseudo-likelihood". 

Reproducing the results can be done by running the Rfile human_gene.R from start to end. This R file consists of three main steps:

1. Loading and cleaning the data
2. Running the algorithms
3. Recreating the figures and tables

All steps are described in the Rfile.
