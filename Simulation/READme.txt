This folder contains the code to reproduce the results of Section 5  of the article: 
"Large-scale Bayesian Structure Learning for Gaussian Graphical Models using Marginal Pseudo-likelihood".

Reproducing the code can be done in two steps:
Step 1: create the simulated data and run the algorithms. This is done in folder "Run Algorithms"
Step 2. Reproduce the tables and figures of Section 5. This is done in folder "Read output"
